			<p style="text-indent:50px"> America's sixth-oldest college, Moravian delivers a values-based liberal arts education in a caring environment, through which it nurtures in students the capacities for leadership, lifelong learning, and positive societal contributions.
The College traces its founding to 1742 by followers of John Amos Comenius, the 17th century Moravian bishop whose humanistic ideals helped to shape modern education. Those ideals that learning should be available to all, that teaching should be in accord with human nature, and that education should be applied to practical uses, are much in evidence at Moravian. Today, the College enrolls students from a great variety of socioeconomic, religious, racial, and ethnic backgrounds; provides for highly personalized learning experiences; and offers many opportunities for students to direct their education toward individual and professional goals.
The College expresses its Moravian heritage in musical and artistic programs of great distinction, which are shared with the Bethlehem community. Together with its cultural offerings, Moravian's handsome historic campuses, the community service of its undergraduates, and its programs of graduate and professional education for adults make it a valued part of the fabric of Bethlehem. Its Moravian Theological Seminary, an ecumenical learning community preparing men and women for Christian leadership, is a global resource.
